   <div class="d1"> Things I Like About CSE 199 </div>
   <br></br>  
   <div class="d3">
   The CSE 199 class is unique class in many different aspects. The main aspect is probably how the class is taught and how the students learn. This class does not have the traditional professor teaching everything course but has videos as well as hands on activities to help students learn about the internet. This is my first time taking a course in this fashion and I have to say I was more motivated for the class than I previous did for any of my other classes. This way of teaching is new and maybe in the experimental phase but it does seem a lot more interesting than the traditional classroom style.

   <div class="d2"> Things I Think CSE 199 Can Improve On </div>
   <br></br> 
   <div class="d4">
   This class in my opinion is successful but can be improved in some ways. Some ways I think this class can improve is having less videos to watch on a various subjects but have longer videos instead. I feel a short 3-5 minute on a video does not really cover the topic enough and people that are really into the topic would generally be disappointed. In my opinion there should probably be around 10 - 15 videos a week but have them about 10- 15 minutes long. The topics we cover should also be decided by the class as topics that students want to learn generally make them more motivated to learn the topic as well as do the activities.
